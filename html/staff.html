      <h2>Dr. Brenda Lovelace</h2>
      <h3>Department Chair, Biological Anthropologist</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Professional Bio</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Lovelace is a graduate of the University of Washington where she obtained her Ph.D. in biological anthropology. She specialized in forensic anthropology and holds a secondary degree in data science. Her primary skills focus on forensic analysis of humain remains and cataloging. She has a very lighthearted demeanor and loves to joke around and play the occasional prank involving an almost illegal number of whoopee cushions (we seriously don't know where she keeps getting these things). Despite this she is nonetheless no-nonsense when it comes to the actual work, demanding precision and accuracy that would make a Vulcan cry. Her skills in cataloging is rivaled only by her skill with the camera which she uses for taking high-resolution images for 3D photogrammetry paired with high-resolution LiDAR scans of artifacts.
      </p>

      <h4>Museum Role</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Lovelace is currently the head of the Anthropology Department. She is also responsible for the design, programming, and continued maintenance of the cataloging system currently in use at our institution.
      </p>

      <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Lovelace has received numerous awards for her work and has worked very hard to bring the anthropology exhibits up to the excellent standards and condition they are in today. She was responsible for launching policies that no longer allowed people to taste the exhibits.<br>

      <h2>Dr. David Taylor</h2>
      <h3>Archaeologist</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Professional Bio</h4>
      <p>Dr. Taylor graduated Harvard with a degree in law. Upon discovering that career path was nothing like it was on television, he went on to get degrees in forestry management from UBC in Canada while minoring in Archaeology. The latter eventually became his primary focus for which he ultimately acquired a doctorate. Very introverted by nature, he tends to work in the shadows, rarely letting his presence be known unless it's to deliver artifacts for analysis in the dead of night before quickly slipping out the back door with the speed and silence of a ninja. Few here know what he looks like. In fact, we're not sure if the photo we have is actually him and not a charismatic guest who just happened to be here during the photo shoot. Based expense reports we can say for certain he loves his notepads and pencils for documenting everything.</p>

      <h4>Museum Role</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Taylor currently holds the position of Head Archaeologist of the Museum (HAM). Aside from field archaeology he has been known to perform archaeology in the museum itself, often finding things we completely forgot even existed and were buried in storage.
      </p>

      <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Taylor spearheaded the "Children Are Our Future" initiative which is a traveling museum that visits schools every year with replicas of our most popular and interesting exhibits. It aims to teach children that if they aren't careful in life they, too, will have strange people poking at their fossilized remains and putting them on display.<br>

      <h2>Dr. Leslie Byrne</h2>
      <h3>Cultural Anthropologist, Linguistic Anthropologist</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Professional Bio</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Byrne is a graduate of the University of Texas where she studied linguistics extensively. She later attended University of Colorado where she acquired her Master's and Ph.D. An outgoing individual and a teacher at heart, she is a friend of everyone at the museum and often loves to take on the role of tour guide for our cultural exhibits when Eugene needs a day off. Her office is a veritable library of cultural and linguistic material and she will most certainly have any book you might need on the subjects. When not giving tours she will often be found lounging in the break room scribbling away on one of a plethora of notebooks in the latest spree of documentation and exhibit curation. Her primary focus is proto-language analysis and has a special interest in the Proto-Indo-European branch and Old Norse. Her work largely involves attempting to reconstruct ancient languages through the lens of the cultures in which they existed, and hopes some day she'll find out just what prehistoric people had to say.
      </p>

      <h4>Interpretive Method</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Byrne scrutinizes and heavily studies the relationship between words in modern languages, analyzes the cultural contexts in which they exist, and works her way back to find links between those and the contexts of words in the proto-languages.
      </p>

      <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Byrne made waves when she joined the museum. Her approach to cultural interpretation through linguistics helped solidify the accuracy of many of our exhibits. Her style of teaching engaged patrons and staff alike, and brightened our once dark hallways by opening a few curtains that were stuck and changing out a few burned-out lightbulbs.<br>
